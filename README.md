How to build
------------
First you need to clone the repository or download the master.zip file.
Once completed, extract the *android-support-v7-appcompat.zip* into the parent folder of the *TicTac2* folder. This is necessary to fullfill library dependencies.
When using Eclipse-ADT simply import both folders as Android Projects and start building :)
