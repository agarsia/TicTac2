TicTac2
=======

How to install
--------------
If you just want to play it, download the https://github.com/agarsia/TicTac2/blob/master/TicTac2.apk?raw=true .apk-file, transfer it to your phone/tablet, install it, and you are ready to play.

How to build
------------
First you need to clone the repository or download the master.zip file.
Once completed, extract the *android-support-v7-appcompat.zip* into the parent folder of the *TicTac2* folder. This is necessary to fullfill library dependencies.
When using Eclipse-ADT simply import both folders as Android Projects and start building :)

Tested
------
Current builds are all tested on HTC Wildfire S (ldpi, API v9) and Motorola Droid Razr (hdpi, API v14)
